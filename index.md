## Course Description

This class will place the late-eighteenth to twentieth century histories of animal breeding, genetic manipulation, and cloning within the context of Empire, colonialism, and post-colonialism. It will also serve as a theoretical and methodological introduction to key issues in Critical Animal Studies, Science and Technology Studies, Empire Studies and the literature on colonialism, while attempting to bridge these disparate, but, as this course will argue, necessarily entangled fields. Crucially, this course will centre Black, Indigenous, and feminist critiques of both the colonial science that produced the animal body as an object of knowledge and consumption in the nineteenth century and beyond, as well as the bodies of literature that address these histories and the human/animal Enlightenment divide from which they emerge. Collectively, we will ask a range of questions regarding the friction and generative tension sparked from studying the linked histories of animals, science, and colonialism. These might include (but are certainly not limited to): how deeply can we engage with animal histories outside of human frames of reference? What kinds of sources might we use to perform such a task, and what kinds of disciplinary boundaries might be reframed in doing so? More specifically, how have colonialism and capitalism shaped the way we understand and interact with animals, and why might de-centring the privileged category of “human” be important in doing this work?

This is a reading and writing intensive course that is designed to foster a high level of engagement with challenging texts and historical problems. It will be challenging in different ways for different students. I encourage you to support one another in a respectful, collegial in-class atmosphere. I also encourage you to seek guidance if you are unsure about any aspects of the course, would like further clarification on any and all issues--critical to custodial! You are always welcome (and highly encouraged) to set up an appointment with me or visit my office hours. 



## Learning Objectives

By end of this course students will be able to:
* Demonstrate a strong grasp on the intersections between gender/race/class in the production of animal bodies as objects of Western scientific and academic knowledge.
* Analyze the content as well as the form of not only textual but visual and and aesthetic sources: film, novels, et cetera.
* Identify and critically engage with the difference (and slippage!) between different kinds of scholarly texts: primary source, theory, and secondary historical scholarship.
* Recognize and assess the methodologies of Animal Studies/Animal History and apply them to an independent research project.
