##### Mix n' Match Primary Source/Theory Analysis (approx. 1500 words): 20% 

**DUE: **

This assignment asks that you think creatively and critically about the interaction between different kinds of scholarly sources. Using **1 Primary Source** and **1 Theoretical Text** from **different units**, write an essay that considers the two texts in relation to each other. You might decide to read the primary source through the theoretical text, testing the limits of the theoretical arguments outlined in the text against the primary document. Alternatively, you could read both the primary source and theoretical text as works of "theory," reading the two together as different approaches to a similar problem. It is up to you how you want to pair these texts and what sorts of arguments you want to make.

This assignment invites deep and close readings of the two texts. Read the texts carefully, asking questions about word choice, rhetorical style, and argumentation. What sorts of language do these texts share? What assumptions do both texts make? For whom is the text written and in what contexts? Note that while no outside research is required, it is not forbidden; however, do make sure to use external sources judiciously if you decide to do so--to note, there is no correlation between the amount of sources in the bibliography and the mark you receive.


##### Animal Genealogy Research Assignment (2000-2500 words) = 25%

**DUE: **

In this assignment, you will sharpen your "animal historian" skill set by tracing the history of one non-human animal throughout empire. There are no formal temporal, spatial, or special (i.e. relating to species) parameters for this project, but, in most cases, you will want to set fairly strict parameters for a paper of this length. The parameters that define "animal" and "empire" are up to you, and you can choose to focus on any animal. 

One approach to this topic would be to pick a famous animal (for instance, Koko the Gorilla or Jumbo the Elephant) and analyze its life and times within empire, broadly defined. Or, you might choose a specific breed of animal (like the Merino breed of sheep) and trace its history. Alternatively, you can choose a specific species (beavers or bees, for instance). (Please come see me in my office hours or set up an appointment if you would like to choose a fictional or mythical animal.)

In all cases, you will need to ensure that your analysis is focused, and that you engage with the themes and questions of the course. Your paper should contain a clear argument supported by primary and secondary evidence. Primary sources, in the context of this paper, can mean anything that deals with the animal in the time period you choose to historcize it within; this can be zoological findings, biological studies, popular representations, et cetera. It should also outline how the animal has been embedded with circuits of empire and why, in the context of this course, this animal is important to "look at". 

Remember that this it not a zoological report; while you can certainly draw on ecological studies of the animal and other scientific texts, the paper should remain a historical analysis of the animal.

I encourage you to see the Reaktion Animal Book Series for inspiration and, in particular, Daniel Heath Justice's book *Badger*. You can certainly choose an animal already explored in the Reaktion series, but you still need to engage with research outside of the confines of that series. 

You paper should include at least **7 secondary sources** and at least **5 primary sources**. You can certainly have more than that, but do be cautious about overloading your paper with additional research. There is no correlation between the number of sources in your bibliography and the mark you receive.
