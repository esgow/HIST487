# Assignments

If you have any questions about the assignments, please come see me in my office hours or set up an appointment. Please check this page regularly as parameters and due dates (in very rare occassions) may change.

In any case where there is a disagreement between a document (i.e. an email, a printed syllabus, et cetera) and this page, this page is taken as the authority.

### Participation: 25%

You are expected, both in seminar and in lecture, to be an active, engaged, and respectful participant in class discussions. Throughout the class, we will be dealing with difficult and contentious topics, and so you are expected to engage with your classmates in respectful and academically appropriate ways. This does not mean that you cannot disagree with someone's argument--of course, scholarly disagreement is at the heart of good academic interchange--but instead that our conversations should be generative and open up space for thinking through the course materials. We are all here to learn and engage with the course content, and our discussions should reflect that willingness and openness. 

Participation will be evaluated holistically, meaning that there is no correlation between the sheer number of times you speak and the grade you will receive. To participate also means to engage others in the conversations and to listen to others.

There is absolutely zero tolerance for homophobia, transphobia, sexism, racism, or any other form of discrimination in this class.


### Weekly Responses (10 @ approx. 250 words): 20%

**DUE: BEGINNING OF CLASS ON THURSDAYS**
**PORTFOLIO DUE: DECEMBER 2**

For 10 of our 13 seminars, you will write a short response to **OR** a set of questions about the assigned readings. Your task on both cases is to synthesize the week's readings, drawing out some points of similarities and differences. It can focus on any aspect of the readings, but it must address all of the assigned readings.

You can submit these papers for any week of your choice, but note that late papers will **not** be accepted. I will return your paper within 2 weeks of the submission with feedback and a grade. You **must** retain a copy of the **graded paper** for submission at the end of the term. At the end of the term, you will submit all 10 of your papers and they will be graded holistically as a single portfolio. While the final grade for this assignment will take into consideration the mathematical average of the individual papers, I am also looking for evidence of improvement; in other words, if you have a bad week, that's okay. 


### Mix n' Match Primary Source/Theory Analysis (approx. 1500 words): 20% 

**DUE: OCTOBER 28**

This assignment asks that you think creatively and critically about the interaction between different kinds of scholarly sources. Using **1 Primary Source** and **1 Theoretical Text** from **different units**, write an essay that considers the two texts in relation to each other. You might decide to read the primary source through the theoretical text, testing the limits of the theoretical arguments outlined in the text against the primary document. Alternatively, you could read both the primary source and theoretical text as works of "theory," reading the two together as different approaches to a similar problem. It is up to you how you want to pair these texts and what sorts of arguments you want to make.

This assignment invites deep and close readings of the two texts. Read the texts carefully, asking questions about word choice, rhetorical style, and argumentation. What sorts of language do these texts share? What assumptions do both texts make? For whom is the text written and in what contexts? Note that while no outside research is required, it is not forbidden; however, do make sure to use external sources judiciously if you decide to do so--to note, there is no correlation between the amount of sources in the bibliography and the mark you receive.


### Animal Genealogy Research Assignment (2000-2500 words): 25%

**DUE: DECEMBER 10**

In this assignment, you will sharpen your "animal historian" skill set by tracing the history of one non-human animal throughout empire. In part, this is a project engaged in a critical "genealogy" of an animal, where "genealogy" (following Foucault and Sarah Franklin) refers to a method of tracing the history of the everyday, of those, in this case, non-human vitalities that seem to be without history. In other words, your task is to investigate the history of animal, taking into consideration the multiple questions and themes of the course


There are no formal temporal, spatial, or special (i.e. relating to species) parameters for this project, but, in most cases, you will want to set fairly strict parameters for a paper of this length. The parameters that define "animal" and "empire" are up to you, and you can choose to focus on any animal. 

One approach to this topic would be to pick a famous animal (for instance, Koko the Gorilla or Jumbo the Elephant) and analyze its life and times within empire, broadly defined. Or, you might choose a specific breed of animal (like the Merino breed of sheep) and trace its history. Alternatively, you can choose a specific species (beavers or bees, for instance) and think about the animal more broadly. However, please come see me in my office hours or set up an appointment if you would like to choose a fictional or mythical animal.

Some questions that you might want to consider include:

* What is this animal's relationship to the nation? Is it a "native" breed or is it invasive? What sorts of governmental policies has restricted or forced its mobility across borders?
* How is this animal normally understood? Is it a household animal or a pest? Is it predator or prey? Is it domestic or wild?
* What sort of scientific knowledges are based around or concern this animal? Is this an animal normally subject to scientific analysis? Would you find this animal in a lab?
* What sorts of relationships does this animal have with other animals, including humans? 
* How has this animal been "storied" historically? That is, what sorts of stories are told about this animal? Is it central to social or political lifeways? 
* When did this animal first enter into "scientific knowledge"?

In all cases, you will need to ensure that your analysis is focused, and that you engage with the themes and questions of the course. Your paper should contain a clear argument supported by primary and secondary evidence. Primary sources, in the context of this paper, can mean anything that deals with the animal in the time period you choose to historcize it within; this can be zoological findings, biological studies, popular representations, et cetera. It should also outline how the animal has been embedded with circuits of empire and why, in the context of this course, this animal is important to "look at." 

Remember that this it not a zoological report; while you can certainly draw on ecological studies of the animal and other scientific texts, the paper should remain a historical analysis of the animal.

I encourage you to see the [Reaktion Animal Book Series](http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/results.asp?SF1=series_exact&ST1=ANIMAL&DS=ANIMAL&SORT=sort_title) for inspiration and, in particular, Daniel Heath Justice's book *Badger*. You can certainly choose an animal already explored in the Reaktion series, but you still need to engage with research outside of the confines of that series. 

You paper should include at least **7 secondary sources** and at least **5 primary sources**. You can certainly have more than that, but do be cautious about overloading your paper with additional research. There is no correlation between the number of sources in your bibliography and the mark you receive. I encourage you to start your research process early on and to see me in my office hours or set up an appointment if you have any questions or concerns.
